ACM-Weekly-Raffle
=================

This is a simple program that randomly picks winners for a weekly raffle.  It stores who has won previously to prevent mutliple winners from appearing, allows you to add users, and add facebook profiles associated with users for displaying winners.  It uses speech sysnthesis to announce the winners name.

When entering a name, the format is: first last:facebookname
